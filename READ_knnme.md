K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for Iris Dataset:

This Python code demonstrates the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using the Iris dataset. The code performs the following steps:
without using inbuilt functions for knn.


Part 1: Data Splitting

The dataset is split into training and testing sets for each class (Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor).

10 samples are taken as the testing set for each class.

The remaining 40 samples are used as the training set for each class.

Part 2: Scatter Plot

Scatter plots are created for the sepal length and width attributes of each class in the training dataset.

Each class is represented by a different color on the scatter plot.


Part 3: Euclidean Distance Calculation

The Euclidean distance is computed for each sample in the testing dataset with respect to the training dataset.

The calculated distances are stored in a DataFrame.



Part 4: Nearest Neighbors Identification

The k value (number of neighbors) is taken as an input from the user.

The nearest k neighbors are identified for each sample in the testing dataset based on the smallest Euclidean distances.

The indices of the nearest neighbors are stored.


Part 5: Majority Class Prediction

For each sample in the testing dataset, the majority class among the nearest neighbors is determined.

The predicted class for each sample is stored in a DataFrame.

Part 6: Accuracy Calculation

The accuracy of the KNN classifier is calculated by comparing the predicted classes with the actual classes in the testing dataset.

The number of correctly predicted samples and the accuracy percentage are displayed

Extension to All Attributes

The code is extended to include all attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for distance calculation and classification.
The steps from Part 3 to Part 6 are repeated with the extended attribute set.


To run the code, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed: numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Additionally, make sure you have the iris.csv dataset in the same directory as the script.

You can execute the code by running the provided Python script. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the value of k for the KNN algorithm.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code as needed for your specific use case.
