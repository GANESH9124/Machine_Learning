K Nearest Neighbors
it is a simple and widely used machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It's a non-parametric and instance-based learning method, meaning it doesn't make explicit assumptions about the underlying data distribution and instead relies on the data itself to make predictions.

Steps involved in KNN:
1.Data Collection and Preparation: Collect the dataset with features and corresponding labels (for classification) or target values (for regression). Ensure the data is properly preprocessed and normalized, as KNN is sensitive to the scale of features.
