K Nearest Neighbors

it is a simple and widely used machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It's a non-parametric and instance-based learning method, meaning it doesn't make explicit assumptions about the underlying data distribution and instead relies on the data itself to make predictions.

Steps involved in KNN:

1.Data Collection and Preparation: Collect the dataset with features and corresponding labels (for classification) or target values (for regression). Ensure the data is properly preprocessed and normalized, as KNN is sensitive to the scale of features.

2.Choosing a K Value:

K is hyperparameter, which signifies the no of nearest neighbors which influence prediction

high value of k lead to smoothly running but potentially biaseed model

low value of k lead to more sensitive and noisy model

3.Distance Metric:

Choose a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, etc.) to measure the similarity between data points. The most common choice is Euclidean distance.

4.Prediction for Classification:

For a new data point, calculate its distance to all other data points in the training set using the chosen distance metric.

Select the K nearest neighbors based on their distances.

Count the occurrences of each class among the K neighbors.

Assign the new data point to the class with the most occurrences among its neighbors.

5.Prediction for Regression:

For a new data point, calculate its distance to all other data points in the training set.

Select the K nearest neighbors.

Calculate the average or weighted average of the target values of the K neighbors.

Use this average as the predicted target value for the new data point.

6.Evaluation:

Use appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Mean Squared Error, etc.) to assess the performance of the KNN model on a separate validation or test dataset.


7.Hyperparameter Tuning:

You might need to experiment with different K values and distance metrics to find the best configuration for your dataset. This can be done using techniques like cross-validation.
